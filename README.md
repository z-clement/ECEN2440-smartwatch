# ECEN2440-smartwatch

The final project for ECEN2440 Embedded Systems. Our group decided to make a smartwatch that has a touchscreen display
with the capabilities to set an alarm and timer using bluetooth.

The project uses an MSP432 as the microcontroller which communicates via UART with the display and bluetooth module.
